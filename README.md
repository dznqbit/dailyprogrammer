Attempts at solving dailyprogrammer problems!

- [125 (Easy) Word Analytics](125-easy-word-analytics) – [Easy Word Analytics](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1e97ob/051313_challenge_125_easy_word_analytics/) – with a vicious, Jameson-fueled refactoring by lukem. Python – `python main.py luke.txt`
- [135 (Easy) Arithmetic](135-easy-arithmetic) – [Easy Arithmetic](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1k7s7p/081313_challenge_135_easy_arithmetic_equations/
) . Python – `python main.py` – reads stdin to define range of operands, so enter something like `1 10`. Maybe there should be a `Usage:` string? Also uses `eval` bc `eval` is awesome.
